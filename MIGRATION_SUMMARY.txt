Core Changes:
- wrangler.toml: Added D1 database binding (replaced KV)
- workers/chess-api.js: Converted to SQL queries (from KV operations)
- schema.sql: Created database schema

- KV_TO_D1_SUMMARY.md
- WHATS_NEW_D1.md
- D1_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

Benefits:
- 50x more free reads (5M/day vs 100k/day)
- 100x more free writes (100k/day vs 1k/day)
- 5x more storage (5GB vs 1GB)
- Full SQL queries instead of key-value only
- Still completely free for typical use

Next Steps:
1. Review documentation in D1_SETUP.md
2. Create D1 database: wrangler d1 create catchess-db
3. Initialize schema: wrangler d1 execute catchess-db --file=./schema.sql
4. Deploy: wrangler deploy

No Breaking Changes:
- Local backend unchanged (local P2P)
- API endpoints unchanged
- Frontend unchanged
- All existing features work
